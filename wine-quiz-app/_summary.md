A comprehensive [React-based web application](https://wine-quiz.tth.dev/) helps wine enthusiasts master varietals and categories through six interactive quiz modes, including category matching, rapid-fire questions, and "odd one out" challenges. The app implements spaced repetition learning using the SM-2 algorithm to optimize review scheduling, tracks daily streaks and mastery percentages, and stores progress locally in the browser. Built with [React 19 and Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), it features text-to-speech pronunciation support for wine names, dark mode theming, and a mobile-first design intended for use alongside wine education materials. Wine data is stored in easily-updateable JSON files covering 40+ wines across eight categories (sparkling, whites, rosé, and reds), with full offline functionality once cached.

**Key Features:**
- Six distinct quiz modes with adjustable difficulty and session length
- Spaced repetition algorithm for personalized learning schedules
- Audio pronunciation using browser speech synthesis with regional voice preferences
- Progress export/import and comprehensive mastery tracking
- Study mode for browsing all wines by category before quizzing
