A mobile-first wine education app built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that helps users master wine knowledge through seven interactive quiz modes, including category matching, pronunciation practice, and rapid-fire challenges. The application implements spaced repetition learning (SM-2 algorithm) to optimize retention and tracks detailed progress metrics including daily streaks and per-wine mastery levels. Wine data is stored as JSON files that can be updated without redeployment, and all user progress persists locally with offline support, making it ideal for studying alongside wine books.

**Key Features:**
- Seven quiz modes covering categories, pronunciation, origins, and descriptions
- Spaced repetition algorithm for personalized review scheduling
- Dark mode, adjustable difficulty, and customizable quiz settings
- Progress tracking with export/import functionality
- Works offline with localStorage caching
