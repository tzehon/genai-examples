MongoDB Ops Manager can be deployed on Kubernetes using MongoDB Controllers for Kubernetes (MCK), providing a production-ready platform that includes automated backup infrastructure, TLS encryption via cert-manager, LDAP authentication, and support for both replica sets and sharded clusters. The project evolved from the deprecated MEKO operator to [MongoDB Controllers for Kubernetes](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kubernetes/current/), incorporating [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) for automated certificate lifecycle management and Istio service mesh for multi-cluster deployments. A streamlined installation process (`_launch.bash`) automates the deployment of MCK operators, Ops Manager with a 3-node application database, backup infrastructure (oplog and blockstore), and managed MongoDB clusters, with external access via split-horizon DNS or LoadBalancer services.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Complete stack deployment**: MCK operator, Ops Manager 8.0.x, backup infrastructure (oplog + blockstore), and production MongoDB clusters
- **Enterprise features**: TLS encryption, LDAP integration, point-in-time recovery, and cross-cluster deployments via Istio
- **Resource scale**: Designed for 48-64 cores, 192-256 GB RAM, with 2-5 TB storage for production workloads
- **Flexible access**: Split-horizon DNS for replica sets, LoadBalancer/NodePort for sharded clusters, with automated certificate management
